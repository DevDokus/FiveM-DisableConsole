# FiveM-DisableConsole
__Prevent players to use the F8 console to see your server files.__ <br>

Right now in FiveM players can use the F8 console and then use the <br>
build in NUI DevTools to see your server files. This is a **huge** <br>
security risk! Players will be able to see your client files and   <br>
therefor its code. Players will be able to inject their own script <br>
or being able to change the code client side. This can be used to  <br>
spawn in items, deplicate items, get your self payed but worse of  <br>
all delete other players characters. This script prevents users    <br>
from using the F8 completely. 

__What does this script do?__ <br>
This script detects when a player uses the F8 button. The moment   <br>
they hit the F8 button, the player will be kicked from the server. <br>

__Whitelist:__ <br>
If you want players/admins to be able to use the F8 console,       <br>
you can whitelist them with their FiveM lisence ID within the      <br>
config file. 

__Other reasons why this is usefull?__ <br>
For roleplay servers this can be usefull in general. Players are   <br>
able to make changes, for examle: Changing their games Gamma.      <br>
This enables them to see more then others the moment its dark.     <br>
This could be the difference between a win or lose during a gun fight.<br>

__ESX or other Frameworks?__<br>
This script can be used with any framework!
